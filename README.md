# CIFAR---10-Image-Recognition-using-ResNet50-
CIFAR - 10 Image Recognition using ResNet50 
This data contains around 60,000 images of shapes which are 32*32 pixels. 
We have 10 different classes like airplane, automative, cars etc. 

First we will build a model using a simple neural network and then we will build a model using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
Here we are going to use ResNet50 which is a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and we train that model with our dataset.
ResNet50 is a pretrained model which will help us with the prediction. 
The prediction on the simple neural network model we are building will not be that great, we are just taking it as an example.
